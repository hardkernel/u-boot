	bool "Support U-Boot commands"
	default y
	help
	  Enable U-Boot's command-line functions. This provides a means
	  to enter commands into U-Boot for a wide variety of purposes. It
	  also allows scripts (containing commands) to be executed.
	  Various commands and command categorys can be indivdually enabled.
	  Depending on the number of commands enabled, this can add

	help
	  This option enables stopping (aborting) of the automatic

	  Note that this define is used as the (only) argument to a

	  string. If CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR or the environment
	  variable "bootstopkey" is specified and this string is
	  received from console input before autoboot starts booting,
	  U-Boot gives a command prompt. The U-Boot prompt never
	  times out, even if CONFIG_BOOT_RETRY_TIME is used.

config AUTOBOOT_KEYED_CTRLC
	bool "Enable Ctrl-C autoboot interruption"
	depends on AUTOBOOT_KEYED && !AUTOBOOT_ENCRYPTION
	default n
	help
	  This option allows for the boot sequence to be interrupted

config CMD_IOTRACE
	bool "iotrace - Support for tracing I/O activity"
	help
	  Provides an 'iotrace' command which supports recording I/O reads and
	  writes in a trace buffer in memory . It also maintains a checksum
	  of the trace records (even if space is exhausted) so that the
	  sequence of I/O accesses can be verified.

	  When debugging drivers it is useful to see what I/O accesses were
	  done and in what order.

	  Even if the individual accesses are of little interest it can be
	  useful to verify that the access pattern is consistent each time
	  an operation is performed. In this case a checksum can be used to
	  characterise the operation of a driver. The checksum can be compared
	  across different runs of the operation to verify that the driver is
	  working properly.

	  In particular, when performing major refactoring of the driver, where
	  the access pattern should not change, the checksum provides assurance
	  that the refactoring work has not broken the driver.

	  This works by sneaking into the io.h heder for an architecture and
	  redirecting I/O accesses through iotrace's tracing mechanism.

	  For now no commands are provided to examine the trace buffer. The
	  format is fairly simple, so 'md' is a reasonable substitute.

	  Note: The checksum feature is only useful for I/O regions where the
	  contents do not change outside of software control. Where this is not
	  suitable you can fall back to manually comparing the addresses. It
	  might be useful to enhance tracing to only checksum the accesses and
	  not the data read/written.

	  This command provides access to board diagnostic tests. These are
	  called Power-on Self Tests (POST). The command allows listing of
	  available tests and running either all the tests, or specific tests
	  identified by name.

config CMD_IRQ
	bool "irq - Show information about interrupts"
	depends on !ARM && !MIPS && !SH
	help
	  This enables two commands:

	     interrupts - enable or disable interrupts
	     irqinfo - print device-specific interrupt information

config CMD_KGDB
	bool "kgdb - Allow debugging of U-Boot with gdb"
	help
	  This enables a 'kgdb' command which allows gdb to connect to U-Boot
	  over a serial link for debugging purposes. This allows
	  single-stepping, inspecting variables, etc. This is supported only
	  on PowerPC at present.

config CMD_LOG
	bool "log - Generation, control and access to logging"
	help
	  This provides access to logging features. It allows the output of
	  log data to be controlled to a limited extent (setting up the default
	  maximum log level for emitting of records). It also provides access
	  to a command used for testing the log system.

config CMD_TRACE
	bool "trace - Support tracing of function calls and timing"
	help
	  Enables a command to control using of function tracing within
	  U-Boot. This allows recording of call traces including timing
	  information. The command can write data to memory for exporting
	  for analsys (e.g. using bootchart). See doc/README.trace for full
	  details.

config CMD_UBI
	tristate "Enable UBI - Unsorted block images commands"
	select CRC32
	select MTD_UBI
	select CMD_MTDPARTS
	default y if NAND_SUNXI
	help
	  UBI is a software layer above MTD layer which admits use of LVM-like
	  logical volumes on top of MTD devices, hides some complexities of
	  flash chips like wear and bad blocks and provides some other useful
	  capabilities. Please, consult the MTD web site for more details
	  (www.linux-mtd.infradead.org). Activate this option if you want
	  to use U-Boot UBI commands.

config CMD_UBIFS
	tristate "Enable UBIFS - Unsorted block images filesystem commands"
	depends on CMD_UBI
	select CRC32
	select LZO
	default y if CMD_UBI
	help
	  UBIFS is a file system for flash devices which works on top of UBI.
