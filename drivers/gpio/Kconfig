config DM_GPIO
	bool "Enable Driver Model for GPIO drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for GPIO access. The standard GPIO
	  interface (gpio_get_value(), etc.) is then implemented by
	  the GPIO uclass. Drivers provide methods to query the
	  particular GPIOs that they provide. The uclass interface
	  is defined in include/asm-generic/gpio.h.

config GPIO_HOG
	bool "Enable GPIO hog support"
	depends on DM_GPIO
	default n
	help
	  Enable gpio hog support

	bool "Disable GPIO uclass sequence themselves with aliases"
	depends on USING_KERNEL_DTB
	default n

	bool "Enable the pca953x command"
	help
	  Deprecated: This should be converted to driver model.

	  This command provides access to a pca953x GPIO device using the
	  legacy GPIO interface. Several subcommands are provided which mirror
	  the standard 'gpio' command. It should use that instead.

config PM8916_GPIO
	bool "Qualcomm PM8916 PMIC GPIO/keypad driver"
	depends on DM_GPIO && PMIC_PM8916
	help
	  Support for GPIO pins and power/reset buttons found on

	bool "Enable sandbox GPIO driver"
	depends on SANDBOX && DM && DM_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports some simulated GPIOs which can be adjusted
	  using 'back door' functions like sandbox_gpio_set_value(). Then the
	  GPIOs can be inspected through the normal get_get_value()
	  interface. The purpose of this is to allow GPIOs to be used as
	  normal in sandbox, perhaps with test code actually driving the
	  behaviour of those GPIOs.

config SANDBOX_GPIO_COUNT
	int "Number of sandbox GPIOs"
	depends on SANDBOX_GPIO
	default 128
	help
	  The sandbox driver can support any number of GPIOs. Generally these
	  are specified using the device tree. But you can also have a number
	  of 'anonymous' GPIOs that do not belong to any device or bank.
	  Select a suitable value depending on your needs.

config CMD_TCA642X
	bool "tca642x - Command to access tca642x state"
	help

	  This provides a way to looking at the pin state of this device.
	  This mirrors the 'gpio' command and that should be used in preference
	  to custom code.

config DM_74X164
	bool "74x164 serial-in/parallel-out 8-bits shift register"
	depends on DM_GPIO
	help
	  Driver for 74x164 compatible serial-in/parallel-out 8-outputs
	  shift registers, such as 74lv165, 74hc595.
	  This driver can be used to provide access to more gpio outputs.

config DM_PCA953X
	bool "PCA95[357]x, PCA9698, TCA64xx, and MAX7310 I/O ports"
	depends on DM_GPIO
	help
	  Say yes here to provide access to several register-oriented
	  SMBus I/O expanders, made mostly by NXP or TI.  Compatible

config MPC85XX_GPIO
	bool "Freescale MPC85XX GPIO driver"
	depends on DM_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports the built-in GPIO controller of MPC85XX CPUs.
	  Each GPIO bank is identified by its own entry in the device tree,
	  i.e.

	  gpio-controller@fc00 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "fsl,pq3-gpio";
		reg = <0xfc00 0x100>
	  }

	  By default, each bank is assumed to have 32 GPIOs, but the ngpios
	  setting is honored, so the number of GPIOs for each bank is
	  configurable to match the actual GPIO count of the SoC (e.g. the
	  32/32/23 banks of the P1022 SoC).

	  Aside from the standard functions of input/output mode, and output
	  value setting, the open-drain feature, which can configure individual
	  GPIOs to work as open-drain outputs, is supported.

	  The driver has been tested on MPC85XX, but it is likely that other
	  PowerQUICC III devices will work as well.

config NCA9539_GPIO
	bool "NCA9539 GPIO port expander driver"
	depends on DM_GPIO
	default n
	help
	  Device model driver support for NCA9539 GPIO expander. It should be
	  usable on many NCA9539 families like NCA9539 & NCA9535.
	  Tested on NCA9539.
